# In the context of version comparison, "2" and "2.0.0.0.1" are not considered equal because they represent different version levels. The shorter version string "2" is usually interpreted as "2.0.0.0.0", so "2.0.0.0.0" should be compared with "2.0.0.0.1".

# [major.minor.patch.build.compilation] => [1.0.0.0.0]

# Here's how the comparison would work:

# "2.0.0.0.0" is compared to "2.0.0.0.1".
# Since the first four components are the same, the comparison comes down to 0 (from "2.0.0.0.0") vs 1 (from "2.0.0.0.1").
# Thus, "2" is less than "2.0.0.0.1".


# If the component of version1 is less than that of version2, it returns -1.
# If the component of version1 is greater than that of version2, it returns 1.
# If all components are equal, the function returns 0.


def version_compare(version1, version2):
    # Split the versions into their components
    v1_parts = [int(part) for part in version1.split('.')]
    v2_parts = [int(part) for part in version2.split('.')]
    
    # Pad the shorter list with zeros
    max_length = max(len(v1_parts), len(v2_parts))
    v1_parts += [0] * (max_length - len(v1_parts))
    v2_parts += [0] * (max_length - len(v2_parts))
    
    # Compare each corresponding part
    for v1, v2 in zip(v1_parts, v2_parts):
        if v1 < v2:
            return -1
        elif v1 > v2:
            return 1
    
    # If all parts are equal, return 0
    return 0


print(version_compare("2", "2.0.0.0.1"))  # Output: -1
print(version_compare("2.0.0.0.0", "2.0.0.0.1"))  # Output: -1
